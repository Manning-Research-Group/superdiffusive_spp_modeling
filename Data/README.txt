The linked folder above contains data used in the SPP modeling project by Giuseppe Passucci working with Megan Brasch, James Henderson, Vasily Zaburdaev and Lisa Manning. All videos are mouse fibroblast cells moving on non-wrinkled, isotropic shape memory polymer substrates prodcued and image captured at the Henderson Lab at Syracuse University. Nuclei were tracked using the ACTIVE tracking package developed by the Henderson and Manning labs (Baker et. al. 2015). Trajectories are stored in a .mat format. More information on this tracking process can be obtained from the Henderson group website and associated manuscripts cited below.
